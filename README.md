# Project Title

Twitter Clone 2.0

## Description

Hello everyone! This Next.js w/ Sanity CMS, TS, SSR, Tailwind and NextAuth. Projects like these aka the really complex ones are what drives me forward to be an even better software engineer. Had a ton of fun coding here, a lot of bugs and a lot of new tech that I haven't used before like Sanity.

Here's a demo:

### Dependencies

All of them are in the package.json, it's a big built but if you want to check it out there's a link up there ^^^

### Executing program

You can just type the piece of code in your terminal at a client folder

```
npm run dev in the twitter-clone-2.0
```
